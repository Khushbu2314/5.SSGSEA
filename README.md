# SSGSEA
Stands for "Single Sample Geneset Enrichment Analysis " 
Interpretation:
Each ssGSEA enrichment score represents the degree to which the genes in a particular gene set are coordinately up- or down-regulated within a sample.
Here white colored areas in the heatmap shows no gene regulated expression whereas green colored part shwos the up-regulated gene expressions whereas the magenta colored shows the down-reguated gene expression.
